Submitted by: **Rithwik Kerur**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp to get all the color names in css

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered when creating this submission was learning the syntax of the languages. Although they were similar
to languages I have used in the past, they all had their differences. However, once I began to notice similarities(classes, 
for loops, if statements, structure, algorithms, declarations, syntax) between these languages and ones I used in the past,
I began to get a better feel of coding in them. Overall, I liked the structure and syntax of these languages as they are 
useful in their own ways for designing a web page. I am excited to learn more about developing a web page in this internship. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
When working on this project, I noticed that we were working on three separate files to make this one webpage. Prior to doing
this project, I thought web development was much simpler that this, and would be much more similar to writing code in Python or 
C++. However, I now know that it is more complicated than I thought as there are elements that I hadn't even though about. 
Although I have a general idea about what each language does in a website, I still have a lot to learn with regards to 
becoming a full-stack developer. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had some more time to work on this project, I would add some more buttons to make the game more complicated. I would 
also change the sounds that each button makes each time the user clicks start to add more variety to the game. I would also
make the buttons start with random colors.
